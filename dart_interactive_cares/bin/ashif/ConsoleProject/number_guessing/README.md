# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

A beginner-friendly Dart console game to learn basic programming concepts.

## Game Rules

- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100
- You have 5 attempts to guess the correct number
- After each guess, you'll get feedback (too high/too low)
- You can play multiple games

## Learning Objectives

This project covers:
- **Variables and Data Types**: int, String, bool
- **User Input**: Reading from console
- **Control Flow**: if-else statements, while loops
- **Functions**: Creating and calling functions
- **Input Validation**: Checking user input
- **Random Numbers**: Using dart:math library
- **String Interpolation**: Using $ to embed variables in strings

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Main Function**: Entry point of the program
2. **Import Statements**: Using dart:io and dart:math
3. **Null Safety**: Handling nullable types with ? and !
4. **Type Conversion**: Converting String to int
5. **Loop Control**: continue and return statements
