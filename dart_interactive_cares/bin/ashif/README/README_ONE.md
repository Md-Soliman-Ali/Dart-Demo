     - List files in a directory
     - Create new files and directories
     - Delete files and directories
     - Copy and move files

2. **Log File Analyzer**
   - Create a program that:
     - Reads log files
     - Analyzes log patterns
     - Generates reports
     - Handles different log formats

3. **Configuration Manager**
   - Create a program that:
     - Reads configuration files
     - Updates settings
     - Validates configuration
     - Handles different file formats (JSON, YAML, etc.)

## Exception Handling

### Learning Path

1. **Understanding Exceptions**
   - [ ] Study different types of exceptions in Dart
   - [ ] Learn when to use exceptions vs. error codes
   - [ ] Understand the exception hierarchy

2. **Basic Exception Handling**
   - [ ] Practice using try-catch blocks
   - [ ] Learn about multiple catch blocks
   - [ ] Understand the finally block
   - [ ] Practice handling specific exceptions

3. **Advanced Exception Handling**
   - [ ] Create custom exceptions
   - [ ] Handle asynchronous exceptions
   - [ ] Implement exception chaining
   - [ ] Practice rethrowing exceptions

4. **Error Recovery**
   - [ ] Learn about graceful degradation
   - [ ] Implement retry mechanisms
   - [ ] Handle resource cleanup
   - [ ] Implement fallback strategies

### Practice Projects
1. **File Operation Handler**
   - Create a program that:
     - Handles file not found exceptions
     - Manages file access permissions
     - Implements retry mechanisms
     - Provides user-friendly error messages

2. **Network Request Handler**
   - Create a program that:
     - Handles network timeouts
     - Manages connection errors
     - Implements retry logic
     - Provides error recovery

3. **Data Validation System**
   - Create a program that:
     - Validates user input
