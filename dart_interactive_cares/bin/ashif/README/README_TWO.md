## 💡 Quick Reference

### When to Use What:

- **🔗 Super**: Always when extending classes with required constructors
- **🔄 Polymorphism**: When you need flexibility with multiple types
- **📊 Static**: For utilities, constants, and class-wide data
- **🏷️ Enums**: For fixed sets of options or states
- **🏗️ Abstract/Interface**: For contracts and shared behavior
- **🧩 Mixins**: For cross-cutting concerns and composition
- **📞 Callbacks**: For async operations and event handling
- **🔄 Higher-Order Functions**: For functional programming patterns

### Key Syntax:

```dart
// Super Keyword
class Child extends Parent {
  Child(String name) : super(name);

  @override
  void method() {
    super.method(); // Call parent method
  }
}

// Polymorphism
List<Animal> animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Bird()];for (
Animal animal in animals) {
animal.makeSound(); // Different sound for each
}

// Static
class MathUtils {
static const double PI = 3.14159;
static double circleArea(double radius) => PI * radius * radius;
}

// Enums
enum Status {
pending('Pending'),
approved('Approved'),
rejected('Rejected');

const Status(this.displayName);
final String displayName;
}

// Abstract Classes & Interfaces
abstract class Shape {
double calculateArea(); // Abstract method
void display() { print("Drawing shape"); } // Concrete method
}

class Circle implements Shape {
// Must implement all abstract methods
}

// Mixins
mixin Flyable {
void fly() => print("Flying");
}

class Bird with Flyable {
// Now Bird can fly()
}

// Callbacks
void fetchData(Function(String) onSuccess, Function(String) onError) {
// Async operation
onSuccess("Data received");
}

// Higher-Order Functions
int performOperation(int a, int b, int Function(int, int) operation) {
return operation(a, b);
}
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names** for all constructs
2. **Keep mixins focused** and cohesive
3. **Prefer composition over inheritance** when possible
4. **Use interfaces for contracts**, abstract classes for shared code
5. **Document your design decisions**
6. **Test polymorphic behavior** thoroughly
7. **Keep callbacks simple** and focused
8. **Use higher-order functions** for reusable logic

## 🚀 Project Ideas to Practice

1. **Animal Zoo System** (polymorphism, inheritance)
2. **Game Character System** (mixins for abilities)
3. **HTTP Client Library** (interfaces, abstract classes)
4. **State Machine for UI** (enums, static utilities)
5. **Plugin Architecture** (mixins, interfaces)
6. **Validation Framework** (mixins, abstract classes)
7. **Calculator App** (higher-order functions)
8. **Event System** (callbacks)
